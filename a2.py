    Main function to run the Dr. Mario game simulation. Handles input for the game configuration,
    initializes the game, and processes commands until the game is over or the user exits the loop.
    Takes configurations from user via input of rows, columns, and field type (EMPTY or CONTENTS).
    The game field is displayed after each command, and the game continues until a game-over condition is met.
